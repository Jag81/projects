If you want to setup your own free website to open yourself up to the world, 
you may have many options, such as Wordpress, Squarespace, Wix, Weebly, 
and many more. But if your want to have full control of your website, 
free hosting and unlimited features (such as using API to connect your 
database or third party data services), the GitHub Pages and Cloudflare 
combination is a good choice. I am happy to help people to setup a personal 
website using GitHub Pages and Cloudflare free services and furthermore 
to build a data driven web application by connecting your database or 
third party data services.
